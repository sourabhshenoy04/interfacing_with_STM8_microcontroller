## Working of code:
1. **On-Board LED Blinking:** 
- #define LED GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_5: This line creates a macro named "LED" that represents GPIOB (Port B) and pin 5 on that port.

- #include "STM8S.h": This line includes a header file necessary for working with the STM8S microcontroller. It likely contains definitions and configurations specific to the STM8S.

- void delay(int ms): This function takes an integer argument ms (milliseconds) and creates a simple delay function using nested loops. The delay is created by iterating ms times, with an inner loop that runs 120 times.

- void main(): This is the main function that serves as the entry point for the program.

- GPIO_DeInit(GPIOB): This line initializes or resets the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) Port B for use.

- GPIO_Init(LED, GPIO_MODE_OUT_PP_LOW_SLOW): This line configures the pin specified by the "LED" macro as a push-pull output with low level (LED is active low) and slow speed.

- while (1) { ... }: This creates an infinite loop that toggles the state of the LED (turns it on or off) using GPIO_WriteReverse(LED) and then introduces a delay of 500 milliseconds using the delay(500) function.

- ***Output:***

2. **On-Board LED with Push Button**
- #define LED GPIOB,GPIO_PIN_5 //onboard LED: This line creates a macro named "LED" representing Port B and pin 5, which is typically connected to an onboard LED.

- #include "STM8S.h": This line includes a header file needed for working with the STM8S microcontroller.

- void delay (int ms): This line declares a function named delay that takes an integer argument ms (milliseconds) and creates a delay using nested loops.

- GPIO_DeInit(GPIOA); and GPIO_DeInit(GPIOB);: These lines reset or initialize Port A and Port B for use.

- GPIO_Init (GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_2, GPIO_MODE_IN_PU_IT);: This line configures pin 2 on Port A as an input with a pull-up resistor and interrupt capability.

- GPIO_Init (GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_5, GPIO_MODE_OUT_PP_LOW_SLOW);//onboard led: This line configures pin 5 on Port B as a push-pull output with low level (onboard LED is active low) and slow speed.

- while (1) { ... }: This creates an infinite loop that checks the state of pin 2 on Port A. If the button connected to this pin is pressed (GPIO_ReadInputPin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_2) is true), it turns on the LED (GPIO_WriteHigh(LED)); otherwise, it turns off the LED (GPIO_WriteLow(LED)).

- delay (100);: After checking the button state and updating the LED, the program introduces a delay of 100 milliseconds.

- The while (1) loop: This is an infinite loop that continually checks if data is received on the UART. If data is received, it reads the received data and checks if it is '0' or '1'. If '0' is received, it turns on the LED; if '1' is received, it turns off the LED.

- void UART_Config(void) { ... }: This is the function definition for configuring the UART. It uses the UART1 module, initializes it with a baud rate of 9600, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity. It also enables the UART receive interrupt and enables the UART1 module.

- TIM2_Cmd(ENABLE);: Enables Timer 2.

- The main loop:

    - The loop starts with a for loop where pwm_duty increases from 0 to 1000 with a step size of 2. This increases the duty cycle of the PWM signal.
    - TIM2_SetCompare1(pwm_duty);: Sets the compare value for Timer 2 Channel 1, effectively controlling the PWM duty cycle.
