## Working of code:
1. **On-Board LED Blinking:** 
- #define LED GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_5: This line creates a macro named "LED" that represents GPIOB (Port B) and pin 5 on that port.

- #include "STM8S.h": This line includes a header file necessary for working with the STM8S microcontroller. It likely contains definitions and configurations specific to the STM8S.

- void delay(int ms): This function takes an integer argument ms (milliseconds) and creates a simple delay function using nested loops. The delay is created by iterating ms times, with an inner loop that runs 120 times.

- void main(): This is the main function that serves as the entry point for the program.

- GPIO_DeInit(GPIOB): This line initializes or resets the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) Port B for use.

- GPIO_Init(LED, GPIO_MODE_OUT_PP_LOW_SLOW): This line configures the pin specified by the "LED" macro as a push-pull output with low level (LED is active low) and slow speed.

- while (1) { ... }: This creates an infinite loop that toggles the state of the LED (turns it on or off) using GPIO_WriteReverse(LED) and then introduces a delay of 500 milliseconds using the delay(500) function.

- ***Output:***
