   - Define pins for the TFT display (CS, CD, WR, RD, RST).

- **TFT Initialization:**
   - Initialize the TFT display with a specified controller ID.
   - Set display rotation, background color (black), text color (white), and text size.

- **Main Loop:**
   - Clear the screen (black).
   - Set the text cursor position.
   - Loop through hue values (0 to 360) in steps of 10.
   - Convert each hue to RGB using the HSVtoRGB function.
   - Set text color to the converted RGB color.
   - Display "hello world" on the screen with the changing rainbow colors.
   - Pause for 200 milliseconds.

- **HSVtoRGB Function:**
   - Converts hue, saturation, and value (HSV) to red, green, and blue (RGB) colors.

3. **Displaying Rainbow Colorful Strips:**
- **Libraries:** The code includes two libraries: `MCUFRIEND_kbv` for TFT display control and `Adafruit_GFX` for graphics functions.

- **Pin Definitions:** Pins for the TFT display (CS, CD, WR, RD, RST) are defined.

- **TFT Initialization:** The TFT display is initialized with the specified controller ID (0x9341), and its rotation is set. Text color, size, and other display settings are configured.

- **Setup Function:**
   - The setup function initializes the TFT display, sets rotation, text color, and size.
   - It then calls a function `rainbowBackground()` to fill the screen with a rainbow (VIBGYOR) background.

- **Loop Function:**
   - The loop function is empty, meaning it doesn't perform any continuous actions. It just runs once after setup.

- **Rainbow Background Function (`rainbowBackground`):**
   - This function creates a rainbow background on the TFT display.
   - Rainbow colors (VIBGYOR) are defined in the `colors` array.
   - The screen height is divided into 7 sections, each corresponding to a color in the rainbow.
   - For each pixel row in the display, a horizontal line is drawn with the color corresponding to its section in the rainbow.
